# 📖 Python for Everybody — Chapter 1: Why We Program

| Key idea | One-sentence takeaway |
|----------|-----------------------|
| **What is a program?** | A set of precise instructions that a computer executes. |
| **Hardware vs. Software** | Hardware is the physical machine; software (programs) tells it what to do. |
| **Programming languages** | High-level languages (Python, Java, C++) let humans write instructions closer to English than machine code. |
| **Source ➜ Compile/Interpret ➜ Execute** | Python is interpreted: the interpreter reads your `.py` file line-by-line and runs it immediately. |
| **Why Python?** | Readable syntax, huge standard library, cross-platform, great for beginners *and* pros. |
| **What you need** | A text editor, the CPython interpreter, and a terminal/IDE to run scripts. |
| **First program** | `print("Hello World!")` demonstrates output to the console. |
| **Debugging mindset** | Coding is largely *fixing mistakes*; develop habits of reading errors and testing small pieces. |

> **Dr. Chuck’s mantra:** *“Programming is a creative, problem-solving activity — not just typing.”*
